# Introduction

All scripts referenced on TradeSeacher are of type "Strategy" on TradingView, which mean they all have built-in alerts and support automated trading.

To automated a TradingView strategy, you need a tool to convert TradingView alerts (webhooks) into a signal that's sent to your broker, whether you're trading cryptocurrencies, stocks, futures or forex.
