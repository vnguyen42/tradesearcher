# Introduction

## What is TradeSearcher?

TradeSearcher is a tool that allows you to automatically find the best TradingView strategies (scripts) for any stock, index, or cryptocurrency.

Our database contains over 100,000 profitable backtests of various strategies on different assets and timeframes to help you find the best performing strategies.

## But, what is a TradingView strategy?

A **TradingView strategy** is a script similar to a technical indicator but with a **fixed set of rules** that define when to buy or sell
a given asset. A TradingView strategy shows **buy and sell arrows** on the chart to indicate when to enter and exit a position.

The advantage of a TradingView strategy is that it can be automated, and the strategy can be **backtested** on historical data to
determine how it would have performed in the past (ROI, Drawdown, etc.).

## How does it work?

TradeSearcher uses a combination of AI and advanced algorithms to find the best TradingView strategies for any asset.
Using advanced automation, TradeSearcher **automatically scans & tests** thousands of trading strategies referenced on TradingView to determine
the best performing strategies.

## Where are the strategies found?

The strategies of TradeSearcher are all **open-source** strategies that can be found on **TradingView**.
Because all strategies are open-source, they can be automated, tested and modified easily. We believe the best strategies are not necessarily the most popular ones,
TradeSearcher allows you to uncover strategies that you may have never heard of before and quickly test newly released strategies.

## Are the strategies tested?
We use **automation** to automatically test strategies on **200+ symbols** and **5+ timeframes** to determine the best performing strategies.
We also perform several tests using AI to eliminate most repainting strategies. This way, more than **35%** of all strategies are **eliminated** from the start.

## How to find the best strategies?
To find the best strategies, you can use the **search** and enter any symbol or asset (e.g. BTCUSDT, SPY, AAPL, etc.) and discover the best performing backtests and strategies.

If you have a premium subscription, you can also explore the **Top Backtests** and **Top Strategies** sections to discover the best performing backtests and strategies on a whole market like **Cryptocurrencies**, **Stocks**, **Indices**, etc.

## What is the benefit of using TradeSearcher?

The benefit of using TradeSearcher is that it eliminates the need to spend 100s of hours searching for the best strategies.
You can discover the best performing strategies **in minutes** and save yourself a lot of time and effort.

## How can these strategies be used?

The best way to use these strategies is either for **daily trading**, by adding them to your chart on TradingView, providing you with buy and sell arrows to take action, or to **automate** (see [automation](/category/automation)) your trading with a high-performing strategy.
